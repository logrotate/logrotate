# Reporting of Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, we'd appreciate a non-public disclosure. To report a security issue, please use GitHub's security advisory feature - Create a new security advisory [here](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/security/advisories/new). It will create a private issue that only you and the project maintainers can see.
