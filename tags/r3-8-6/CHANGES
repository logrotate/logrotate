3.8.5 -> 3.8.6
	- Fixed memory corruption caused by rotation directory which does not
	  exist with "sharedscripts" together with "prerotate" script.

3.8.4 -> 3.8.5
	- Improved rotation during daylight saving time and between timezone
	  changes.
	- Fixed ACL setting problem caused by ext3 erroneously reporting ENOSYS
	  instead of ENOSUP.
	- Do not continue with rotation if state file is corrupted.
	- Make logrotate.status creation atomic.
	- Allow "hourly" rotation. See manpage for more information.
	- Use "/bin/echo" in tests. Fixes tests execution in Dash.
	- Do no try to parse config files bigger than 16MB.
	- Improved manpage consistency and formatting.
	- Fix race condition between acl_set_fd() and fchmod().

3.8.3 -> 3.8.4
	- Added --version command line option
	- Disable ACL tests if logrotate is not compiled WITH_ACL support or if 
	  ACLs are not supported by the system running tests
	- Disable SELinux tests if logrotate is not compiled WITH_SELINUX support
	  or if SELinux is not supported by the system running tests
	- Fixed bug which prevented skipping particular log file config
	  if the config contained errors.
	- Fixed skipping of configs containing firstaction/lastaction scripts
	  with '}' character in case of error before these scripts.
	- Support also 'K' unit for *size directives.
	- Added preremove option to let admin to do something with the old logs
	  before they are removed by logrotate.
	- Fixed possible loop in tabooext parsing.
	- Move code to set SELinux context before compressLogFile calls to create
	  compressed log files with the proper context.
	- Call prerotate/postrotate script only for really rotated files in
	  nosharedscripts mode (as stated in man page).

3.8.2 -> 3.8.3
	- Fixed setting "size" bigger than 4GB on 32bit architectures
	- Do not overwrite mode set by "create" option when using ACL. "create"
	  directive is now not mixed up with ACLs. If you use "create" in config
	  file and log file has some ACLs set, ACLs are not kept and are
	  overwritten by the mode set in "create" directive.
	- Mode argument in "create" directive can be omitted. Only owner and group
	  is set in this case. Check man page for more info.

3.8.1 -> 3.8.2
	- show error and ignore config if '{' is not present after log files
	  declaration
	- support whitespaces in compressoptions directive
	- support for tilde expansion in config files
	- 'su' directive does not affect script execution - scripts
	  are executed as a root if 'su' directive is present
	- fixed mail sending for 'mailfirst', 'dateext' and 'delaycompress'
	  combination
	- do not use gzip/gunzip from /usr/local on Solaris
	- add O_NOFOLLOW when opening files as safeguard against symlink tricks.
	  Symlinks rotation is now officially unsupported. It didn't work
	  as expected in the past anyway.
	- do not run external programs with uid != euid
	- fixed potential bad-free when ACL is used
	- Do not include alloca.h on NetBSD, since alloca() is declared in
	  stdlib.h there
	- 13 new tests added

3.8.0 -> 3.8.1
	- fixed 1 memory leak in prerotateSingleLog
	- another fixes for Solaris
	- fixed HP-UX compilation and default config 
	- do not redirect logrotate errors to /dev/null in cron script
	- fixed "size" directive parsing
	- handle situation when acl_get_fd is supported, but acl_set_fd is not
	- added "maxsize" directive (see man page)

3.7.9 -> 3.8.0
	- added "dateyesterday" option (see man page)
	- fixed crash when config file had exactly 4096*N bytes
	- added WITH_ACL make option to link against -lacl and preserve ACLs
	  during rotation
	- added "su" option to define user/group for rotation. Logrotate now
	  skips directories which are world writable or writable by group
	  which is not "root" unless "su" directive is used.
	- fixed CVE-2011-1098: race condition by creation of new files
	- fixed possible shell injection when using "shred" directive (CVE-2011-1154)
	- fixed escaping of file names within 'write state' action (CVE-2011-1155)
	- better 'size' directive description
	- fixed possible buffer-overflow when reading config files
	- NetBSD/FreeBSD compilation fixes
	- Solaris compilation fixes

3.7.8 -> 3.7.9
	- fix building on Solaris (patch by András Szilárd)
	- don't copy config files on the stack -- mmap them instead
	  (fixes segfaults with too large/invalid config files)
	- symlinked conf file man page as requested by Fedora guidelines
	  (thanks to Ivana Hutarova Varekova)
	- cron script logrotate.cron redirects output to /dev/null
	- added rotating (copying) non-writable, readable files
	  (patch by Henrique Martins)
	- fixed missingok problem with globs
	  (taken from the Debian patches by Ted Percival 
	   <ted@midg3t.net>)
	- fixed bug when log files could be removed even there was
	  some error in rotation process.
	- allow setting size greater than 4.2GB in configuration file
	- pass currently rotated file to postrotate/prerotate script
	  in nosharedscripts mode
	- added new TabooExts: ".disabled", ".dpkg-old", ".dpkg-dist",
	  ".dpkg-new", ".cfsaved", ".ucf-old", ".ucf-dist", ".ucf-new"
	  (taken from the Debian patches by Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>)
	- Don't change utime atime/mtime when compressing files
	  (taken from the Debian patches by Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>)
	- Better *rotate scripts parser. (taken from the Debian patches)
	- Allow 'include' directive in log file definitions

3.7.7 -> 3.7.8

	  with spaces in the name -- this changes the version number of
	  the state file!
	- ignore white space at end of line

3.3.1 -> 3.3.2:
	- don't rotate lastlog
