     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.


If you want to add the Access Control List (ACL) support to the program
use `make WITH_ACL=yes' at the point 2 and `make test WITH_ACL=yes' at 
the point 3.

the program use `make WITH_SELINUX=yes' at the point 2.

If you want to add both the ACL and SELinux supports to the program use
`make WITH_ACL=yes WITH_SELINUX=yes' at the point 2 and 
`make test WITH_ACL=yes' at the point 3.
