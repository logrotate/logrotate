2.3 -> 2.4:
	- glob log names in config file
	- added ,v to taboo list
	- fixed bug w/ create parsing

2.2 -> 2.3:
	- fill in all of last rotated structure (this probable isn't
	  really necessary but it's a bit cleaner and will avoid future
	  problems);
	- fixed .spec file

2.1 -> 2.2:
	- If a file is rotated and we have no state information for it,
	  right out the current time.
	- Weekly rotation happens when the current weekday is less then
	  the weekday of the last rotation or more then a week has
	  elapsed between the last rotation and now
	- Monthly rotation happens when the current month is different
	  from the last month or the current year is different from the
	  last year
	- (these were contributed and suggested by Ronald Wahl)
	- added olddir/noolddir options
	- added ifempty/notifempty options
	- ignore nonnormal files when reading config files from a directory
	- (these were suggested and originally implemented by 
	  Henning Schmiedehausen)
	- updated the man page to reflect these changes
	- made "make install" accept PREFIX argument
	- added .spec file to tarball

2.0.2 -> 2.1:
	- Don't output state information for logs that have never been
	  rotated (better then 1900-1-0)
	- Accept 1900-1-0 as time 0
	
2.0.1 -> 2.0.2:
	- I have no idea :-(

2.0 -> 2.0.1:
	- ignore files in included directories which end with ~, .rpmorig, or
	  .rpmsave
