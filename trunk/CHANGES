2.5 -> 2.6:
	- added nodelaycompress flag (from Jos Vos)
	- added copytruncate, nocopytruncate flag (from Jos Vos)
	- removed umask handling; explicitly use fchmod() insteadmoved umask
	- added --force option (Simon Mudd)
	- moved /bin/mail to MAIL_COMMAND define (Simon Mudd)
	- fixed segv caused by overly long filenames

	  problems);
	- fixed .spec file

2.1 -> 2.2:
	- If a file is rotated and we have no state information for it,
	  right out the current time.
	- Weekly rotation happens when the current weekday is less then
	  the weekday of the last rotation or more then a week has
	  elapsed between the last rotation and now
	- Monthly rotation happens when the current month is different
	  from the last month or the current year is different from the
	  last year
	- (these were contributed and suggested by Ronald Wahl)
	- added olddir/noolddir options
	- added ifempty/notifempty options
